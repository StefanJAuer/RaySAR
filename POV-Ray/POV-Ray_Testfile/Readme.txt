Note: This file works only with the adapted POV-Ray version as only this 
is able to intepret the key words SAR_Output_Data and SAR_Intersection in 
the global settings command (see line 6 of Step.pov). As a result, running Step.pov should provide a
png image + a text file Contributions.txt containing information for the
subsequent image generation part.
