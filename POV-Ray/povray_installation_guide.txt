Using and compiling of adapted POV-Ray for RaySAR: 

Note that a compiled .exe-file of POV-Ray 3.7 for RaySAR on Windows can be already found in the folder 
RaySAR-POV-Ray_compiled. Recompiling the code (recommendation: use Visual C 2012 or older) is only necessary if the code of the ray tracing 
process is changed, e.g. in order to add further signal reflection levels beyond 5 or export further information into 
the text file Contributions.txt. If this is not the case, just use the existing exe file for your work, which is 
found in the folder POV-Ray $\rightarrow$ POV-Ray\_3.7\_for\_RaySAR_compiled. If this is not the case, just use the 
existing exe file for your work, which is found in the folder POV-Ray -> POV-Ray 3.7 for RaySAR compiled. Note, that 
regular POV-Ray 3.7. has to be installed first, which is also included in the package, see folder 
POV-Ray -> POVRay_3.7_original_Windows.

Instruction for building POV-Ray 3.7 from the provided source code:

Extract the .zip-file povray-3.7.0.0_for_raysar-master.zip in the package and compile it (see instructions below).
