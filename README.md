# RaySAR
Welcome and thank you for your interest in RaySAR :-) (just follow the link "Releases" or click on "RaySAR v1.2" on the right of this page to get access). 

To start with, I will try to summarize the main properties of the software package you are interested in.

RaySAR is a 3D synthetic aperture radar (SAR) simulator which enables to generate SAR image layers related to detailed 3D object models. Moreover, it enables one to localize the 3D positions and surface intersection points related to reflected radar signals. In particular, RaySAR helps to understand the nature of signal multiple reflections at man-made objects (e.g. building structures) or artificial shapes. Scene models with different levels of detail can be processed - from digital surface models (DSMs) to high-end 3D structures - which can be defined in relative or absolute world coordinates. RaySAR can be run on Windows / Linux and is based on an adapted version of the open-source ray tracer POV-Ray.

Publications on RaySAR and related applications can be found here: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stefan_Auer/contributions

RaySAR has been developed in the course of a doctoral thesis at TUM, Munich, in cooperation with the German Aerospace Center (DLR). There are experimental parts but also parts which have been applied in the context of various case studies. In particular, 2D (-> maps) and 3D (-> phase center positions) simulation products have been generated for various building models. 

Feel free to change / adapt / enhance RaySAR in the course of your work. Good luck with your projects :-).
